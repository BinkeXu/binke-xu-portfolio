/**
 * App Component Test Suite
 * 
 * This file contains unit tests for the main App component of the portfolio website.
 * It demonstrates the testing setup and provides a foundation for component testing.
 * 
 * Testing Tools Used:
 * - @testing-library/react: React component testing utilities
 * - Jest: JavaScript testing framework
 * - jest-dom: Custom DOM matchers for Jest
 * 
 * Note: This is a template test file that should be updated to test
 * actual portfolio website functionality rather than the default React content.

/**
 * Example Test Case
 * 
 * This test demonstrates basic component rendering and text content verification.
 * It should be updated to test actual portfolio website features such as:
 * - Navigation functionality
 * - Component rendering
 * - User interactions
 * - Responsive behavior
 * 
 * Current test checks for placeholder content that should be replaced
 * with actual portfolio website testing.
